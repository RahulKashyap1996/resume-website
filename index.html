                                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Designed and deployed unattended A360 bots to automate network health monitoring for Deutsche Telekom's enterprise infrastructure. The solution integrated with Elasticsearch APIs to collect real-time network performance metrics including latency, packet loss, bandwidth utilization, and node availability. Implemented Python-based data transformation pipelines to process and normalize telemetry data from multiple sources. Developed automated reporting workflows that publish actionable insights to Power BI dashboards for network operations teams, enabling proactive issue detection and reducing mean-time-to-resolution (MTTR) by 65%.</p>
                                <p><strong>Key Achievements:</strong> Automated monitoring of 5,000+ network nodes across 12 regions, reduced manual audit time from 40 hours to 2 hours per week, improved network uptime SLA compliance from 94% to 99.2%, and created real-time alerting system for critical threshold breaches.</p>
